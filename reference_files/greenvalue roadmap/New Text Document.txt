Here's a comprehensive list of all errors encountered and fixed during this session, plus remaining ones:

✅ Fixed Errors
#	Error	File	Root Cause	Fix
1	'RAGConfig' object has no attribute 'chunk_overlap'	
config.py
ingestion.py
 uses config.chunk_overlap but only child_chunk_overlap existed	Added @property chunk_overlap alias
2	model 'llama3.2:1b' not found (404)	Ollama	Router uses llama3.2:1b but only 3b was pulled	Pulled llama3.2:1b model
3	llm_model: str = "llama3" (wrong model)	
config.py
Pipeline LLM used llama3 which doesn't exist	Changed to llama3.2:3b
4	'NoneType' object has no attribute 'log_query'	
pipeline.py
RAG init failed (due to #1), so _memory was None	Fixed by resolving #1
5	[Errno 111] Connection refused	
pipeline.py
self._graph.get_graph_context() tries to connect to Neo4j (not running)	Wrapped in try/except
6	YOLO11 service unavailable: Read timed out	
vision_rag_integration.py
Startup race condition — checks /health before FastAPI is ready	Made health check lazy
7	Collection 'greenvalue_child' already exists! (409)	
store.py
_collection_exists
 checked points_count > 0 — empty collections returned False	Changed to just check existence
8	No PDF files found	
pipeline.py
 / 
ingestion.py
ingest_directory()
 hardcoded /app/data/books, config had /app/data/knowledge_base/books	Passed config.knowledge_base_path and updated default to /app/infrastructure/qdrant/knowledge_base/books
9	YOLO11 analysis failed: 404 (POST /analyze/property)	
vision_rag_integration.py
YOLO11Interface posts to /analyze/property which doesn't exist in 
main.py
Not yet fixed — needs endpoint or URL correction
10	RAG system not wired to Vision-RAG	
main.py
MultiModalRAGPipeline()
 created without rag_system param	Passed 
get_rag_instance()
 to constructor
11	Default YOLO11 hostname ai-engine wrong	
vision_rag_integration.py
Service name doesn't resolve inside same container	Changed to localhost
⚠️ Remaining / Future Issues
#	Error	File	Status
1	HTTP Error 403: Forbidden on PDF ingestion	
ingestion.py
Some PDFs (DRM/image-heavy) fail during OCR — needs error handling improvement
2	/analyze/property endpoint missing	
main.py
YOLO11 vision analysis endpoint not created yet
3	Neo4j/Graph DB not running	
docker-compose.yml
KnowledgeGraph needs a graph database — currently gracefully skipped
4	Qdrant collections empty until ingestion completes	—	Ingestion running now, will resolve once complete
5	Sustainable Construction book (441MB) may timeout/OOM	
ingestion.py
Very large PDF could cause issues during OCR processing
